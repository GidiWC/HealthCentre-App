#  Doctor Appointment Booking Website

This project is a Doctor Appointment Booking System built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows patients to view doctors, their specialties, schedules, and fees, then book a session online with simulated approval from the doctor.



##  Overview

This project serves as a hands-on exercise in web development. It demonstrates:
- Displaying doctor profiles with photos, fees in South African Rands, and availability.
- A simple booking workflow where patients select a doctor, choose a date, and fill in personal and payment details (Card, EFT, Cash).
- Simulated doctor approval (random accept/reject) upon form submission for a realistic touch.



##  How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Navigate through the site:
   About Us : Learn about the clinicâ€™s background.
   - Doctors: Browse and select a doctor.
   - Book Appointment: Fill out the form and confirm your booking.
4. A popup will display a booking summary and whether the doctor approved or declined.



##  Purpose

This project is designed to test and demonstrate web development skills, including:
- Structuring clean and responsive UI with HTML & CSS.
- Adding interactivity and logic using JavaScript.
- Building a basic but complete user journey: from selection to booking confirmation.
